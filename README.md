We first take a look at housing units by year to see the annual trend in number of units. 
Then Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot.
Now compare gross rents to sales price per square foot in a line plot to see the relationship between the two. 
Finally, we use longitude and latitude to look at an interactive map to see where the neighborhoods are and can hover over them to see quick stats.
